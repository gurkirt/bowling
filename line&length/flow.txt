🎯 Corrected Flow:
Step 1: Camera Start
Camera starts, startCamera() called
Cyclic buffer begins filling
Status: "Resting..." (orange)
Step 2: Buffer Filling (2 seconds)
Frames continuously added to cyclic buffer
Status: "Resting..." (orange)
Debug: "Buffering... (X/60 frames, Ys elapsed)"
Step 3: Buffer Ready
After 2 seconds, buffer is full (60 frames)
Status: "Ready" (green)
"TRIGGER!" button becomes available (red)
Step 4: Continuous Buffer Updates
Cyclic buffer continues updating (rolling 2-second window)
Status: "Ready" (green)
"TRIGGER!" button remains available
Step 5: Trigger Pressed
Status: "Recording..." (red)
Records 5 seconds total (2s buffer + 3s recording)
"TRIGGER!" button disabled
Step 6: Recording Complete
Status: "Resting..." (orange)
5-second rest period for video writing
"TRIGGER!" button disabled
Step 7: Buffer Reset and Ready
Buffers cleared - Recording buffer cleared, trigger time reset
Cyclic buffer continues - Still rolling 2-second window
Status: "Ready" - If buffer is still full
"TRIGGER!" button - Becomes available again

📱 Expected Behavior Now:
Start Camera → "Resting..." (orange) - Building buffer
After 2 seconds → "Ready" (green) - Buffer full
"TRIGGER!" button → Available and red
Trigger pressed → "Recording..." (red) - 5 seconds
After recording → "Resting..." (orange) - 5 seconds rest
After rest → "Ready" (green) - Buffer reset, ready for next trigger
The app should now properly cycle through all states and continuously maintain the cyclic buffer! 🎉
